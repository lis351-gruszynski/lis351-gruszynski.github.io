	<h3>About the Course</h3>

	<p>Erin Hills is a golf course is southeastern Wisconsin. The public course first opened in 2006 and has hosted many notable golf tournaments since. The biggest tournament was the U.S. Open Championship in 2017. My favorite 3 courses at Erin are:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Hole 1</dt>
		<dd>The opening hole at Erin Hills. Its a par 5 with a fairway that feeds to the marsh on the left. </dd>
	<dt>Hole 12</dt>
		<dd>A par 4. It's considered Erin Hills' signature hole.</dd>
	<dt>Hole 18</dt>
		<dd>A 622 yard par 5. It has over 20 bunkers and an average score above par.</dd>

You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6jXUD6cjGY">here</a>. I have been given permission by photographer Christian Hafer to re-use and publish the photos "copyright-free".
