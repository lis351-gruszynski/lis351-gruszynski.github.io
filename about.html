	<h3>Working Out!</h3>
	<p>I love working out! Because of how busy the Nick is, I have a membership at the Anytime Fitness on East Campus Mall. It's a lot less crowded and has longer operating hours.</p>
	<h3>Playing with my cat!</h3>
	<p>For my birthday I got a cat from the Humane Society. Her name is Mila and she was only 4 months when I got her. I look forward to seeing her when I come home from class and work.</p>
	<h3>Golfing!</h3>
	<p>In the summer I love to golf. I first started when I was a freshman in high school. It's gotten me many job opportunities and business connections that weren't previously possible.</p>
