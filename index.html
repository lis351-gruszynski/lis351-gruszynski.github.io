	<h2>Welcome, I'm Chloe!</h2>
	
	<p>I am currently a junior enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Wisconsin School of Business. I'm pursuing a double major in Marketing and MHR (management and entrepreneurship) and obtaining a certificate in Digital Studies. In the Fall of 2021 I completed a Digital Marketing Professional Certificate from the University of Wisconsin. Through the ten month course I've had the ability to learn a handful of skills, some notably being web development, search engine optimization, email marketing and social media marketing.</p>

	<p>I work part-time for UW-Madison's Division of Continuing Studies as a Digital Marketing Intern during the school year. Additionally, during the summer, I caddie full-time at Erin Hills Golf Course. My future plans include starting my own digital marketing agency working for small businesses on building their digital presence and improving advertising strategy.</p>
