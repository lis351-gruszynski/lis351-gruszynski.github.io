	<h2>Welcome, I'm Chloe!</h2>
	
	<p>I am currently a junior enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a double major in marketing and MHR (Management and Entrepreneurship) with a certificate in Digital Studies. During the week you can find me studying at the UW Business School, hanging out with friends or working out at the gym. I enjoy golfing in the summer and cheering on the various Wisconsin sports teams. </p>
	
	<p>In addition to my undergraduate work, I am also in the process of completing a Digital Marketing professional certificate from the University of Wisconsin through the Office of Engineering-Professional Development. Through the ten month course I've had the ability to learn a handful of skills, some notably being web development, search engine optimization, email marketing and social media marketing. </p>
	<p>I'm super excited to announce that I will be interning with the American Marketing Association as a B2B Marketing Intern for 8 weeks in the spring semester! Normally, though, I work part-time for UW-Madison's C.H.E.S.S. as a Communications Assistant during the school year. Additionally, during the summer, I caddie full-time at Erin Hills Golf Course. My future plans include starting my own digital marketing agency working for small businesses on building their digital presence and improving advertising strategy.</p>
