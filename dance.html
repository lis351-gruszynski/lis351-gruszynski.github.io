	<h2>Hypnotiq Dance Crew</h2>

	<h3>About the Team</h3>

	<p>Hypnotiq is a club dance team that performs at many events on and off campus. With a focus on appreciating diversity and giving back to the community, Hypnotiq provides dancers with an opportunity to develop, choreograph, and perform.</p>

	<h3>My Dance Background</h3>

	<p>I grew up dancing on a competition team that traveled around the country. After participating in that for over ten years, I moved on the high school dance. There it was a lot more fun and I got to have creative freedom with the routines. That's where I also learned about my passion for hip hop. </p>

	<p>I joined Hypnotiq my sophomore year and participated in 6 routines. This year, I'm participating in 6 again as well as choreographing my own. Next year I hope to run for a position on the executive board and choreograph another routine.</p>
